# Auditory_cortex
PBM project for modelling primary auditory cortex (A1) iso-frequency columns, following Loebel et al. (2007) model. (https://doi.org/10.3389/neuro.01.1.1.015.2007)

# How to use Auditory_cortex.m
The code is meant to be used for simulating an arbitrary number of columns, each containing an arbitrary (but equal among columns) number of excitatory and inhibitory neurons. Te simulation outputs an activation level of each neuron (E or I, for excitatory and inhibitory neurons respectively) and its synaptic resources (x or y respectively) over time. Below, is a step by step guide to run your own simulations.

## 1. Set the networks parameters:
The first section of the code has all the parameters introduced 
## 1. Input stimulus:
- Create a starting time variable
